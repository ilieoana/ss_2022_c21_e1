## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up comprehensive integration testing for Spring Security configurations.
- This lesson involves implementing proper testing strategies for secured Spring Boot applications.
- In achieving this, the following concepts were implemented:
  - Spring Security Test Support - Using @SpringBootTest and Spring Security test annotations to create realistic test scenarios; 
  - MockMvc Integration - Setting up MockMvc with Spring Security's FilterChainProxy to test secured endpoints; 
  - Authentication Testing - Testing different authentication scenarios including successful and failed login attempts; 
  - Authorization Testing - Verifying that role-based access control works correctly across different user roles;
